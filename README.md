#  Chess Game

My first ever significant project, written in Python. Intended to be played in Windows Termianl.

## How to Play:
- Download ChessGame.py and ChessPieces.py, place in same directory, double-click on ChessGame.py to start
- To move a piece, type the square in which it is located, followed by the square you wish to move it
to. For example, If white wants to move its pawn located at a2 up two squares to a4, they would type "a2 a4"
- To castle the king, move the king two spaces in the direction you wish to castle. The rook will be
moved automatically. For example, If white wants to castle on the queen (left) side, they would type
"e1 c1". The king will be moved to c1 and the leftmost rook to d1.
- At the beginning of your turn, you may type rules to review the movement rules for each piece, 
or "usage" to remind yourself how to move pieces.

## Notes:
- This game was intended to be played in a dark theme. If your terminal window is light themed, the colors are all opposite.
- On Windows, white pawns render as off-center, purple emojis. I have decided to replace them with diamonds.
